Facebook Connect PHP login
Written by: Alex Manelis <amanelis@gmail.com>

Edit line 7, 8, 11, and 103, on fbconnect.php with 
your facebook, secret credentials. 
On line 11, be sure that it looks like this:

line 11
before: $fb_user_cookie = $_COOKIE['YOURKEY_user'];
after:  $fb_user_cookie = $_COOKIE['basdl2391309hbnfld9b1b2802f3_user'];

As for line 7 and 8 you just need to input your
credentials between single quotes. 

You also need to change the KEY on line 103.

Database configuration, on line 42 you will see
a database query. You should configure or include
your database file on the top near the facebook include.
I stored the user id on the users that logged in on my
site, this way when they come back or are new users,
the site knows how to handle them.

Not sure where I found the fbconnect.js, but for this project
you do not need it. I included it because it is helpfull,
but for the project fbconnect.php is what is needed.
