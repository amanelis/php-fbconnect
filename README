Facebook Connect PHP login
Written by: Alex Manelis <amanelis@gmail.com>

Edit line 8, 9, 12,, and 96, on fbconnect.php with 
your facebook, secret credentials. 
On line 12, be sure that it looks like this:

line 11
before: $fb_user_cookie = $_COOKIE['YOURKEY_user'];
after:  $fb_user_cookie = $_COOKIE['basdl2391309hbnfld9b1b2802f3_user'];

As for line 8 and 9 you just need to input your
credentials between single quotes. 

You also need to change the KEY on line 96.

Database configuration, on line 64 you will see
a database query. You should configure or include
your database file on the top near the facebook include.
I stored the user id on the users that logged in on my
site, this way when they come back or are new users,
the site knows how to handle them. The column name I used
in my database is 'fb_uid'

Not sure where I found the fbconnect.js, but for this project
you do not need it. I included it because it is helpfull,
but for the project fbconnect.php is what is needed. 

The easiest file to get rolling with is the fbconnect_js.php, 
all you need to do is input your key in the FB.init js function
and you are ready to go. I would recommend using those js functions
inside of the fbconnect.php, that way you can utilize databse usage
through php. Have fun and enjoy this script. You will have to do 
some customization, but if you are on github I'm sure you know how to
code.
