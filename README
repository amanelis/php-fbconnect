Facebook Connect PHP login
Written by: Alex Manelis <amanelis@gmail.com>

Edit line 10, 11, and 21, on connect.php with 
your facebook, secret credentials. 
On line 21, be sure that it looks like this:

line 21
before: $fb_user_cookie = $_COOKIE['YOURKEY_user'];
after:  $fb_user_cookie = $_COOKIE['basdl2391309hbnfld9b1b2802f3_user'];

As for line 10 and 11 you just need to input your
credentials between single quotes. 

You also need to change the KEY on line 100.

Database configuration, on line 69 you will see
a database query. You should configure or include
your database file on the top near the facebook include.
I stored the user id on the users that logged in on my
site, this way when they come back or are new users,
the site knows how to handle them. The column name I used
in my database is 'fb_uid'

The easiest file to get rolling with is the javascripts/index.html, 
all you need to do is input your key in the FB.init js function at
the bottom of the page and you are ready to go.

IMPLEMENTATION:
************************************************
You can use this file as a header.php on the top of your page
to ensure facebook login. Once logged in you can display data
based on $fb_uid isset. Since this page either displays the 
fb login button or the welcome message this page can be your 
login include file.
